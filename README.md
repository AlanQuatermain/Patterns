# Patterns

Patterns is a Swift framework for finding text patterns, similar in functionality to regex.

Its primary goal is to be easier to read than regexes, and fully Unicode compliant.

## Features

- [x] Easier to read
- [x] Easier to write
- [x] Cross-platform
- [x] Negation 

## Examples

- [Parsing Unicode property data files](https://nottoobadsoftware.com/blog/textpicker/patterns/parsing_unicode_property_data_files/)

## Usage

### Defining patterns

`Literal("some text")` matches that exact text.

`OneOf("aeiouAEIOU")` matches any single character in that string.

```swift
OneOf(description: "lowercaseASCII") { character in
	character.isASCII && character.isLowercase
}
```

takes a closure `@escaping (Character) -> Bool)` and matches any character for which the closure returns `true`. The description parameter is only used when creating a textual representation of the pattern.

`digit.repeat(2)` matches 2 of that pattern in a row. `digit.repeat(0...1)` matches 0 or 1 (so it is optional), `digit.repeat(...2)` matches 0, 1 or 2 and `digit.repeat(2...)` matches 2 or more. These always match as many characters as possible, so a pattern like `digit.repeat(1...) digit` will never match anything because the repeated digit pattern will always take all the digits, leaving none left for the single digit pattern.

`a || b` first tries the pattern on the left. If that fails it tries the pattern on the right.

`Patterns(Literal("name: '"), letter.repeat(1...), Literal("'"))` matches a series of patterns. If that specific combination of patterns is invalid it will crash. You can use `try Patterns(verify: Literal("name: '"), letter.repeat(1...), Literal("'"))` to throw an error instead.

If your pattern contains several literals it might be easier to read using string interpolation: `Patterns("name: '\(letter.repeat(1...))'")`. This is the same as the previous example.

`Skip()` matches 0 or more characters until a match for the rest of the pattern up to the next `Skip`. So `Patterns("name: '\(Skip())'")` is a better version of the examples above if you also want to include names with non-letter characters.


### Predefined patterns

There are predefined patterns for all the boolean `is...` properties of Swift's `Character`: `letter`, `lowercase`, `uppercase`, `punctuation`, `whitespace`, `newline`, `hexDigit`, `digit`, `ascii`, `symbol`, `mathSymbol`, `currencySymbol`.

They all have the same name as the last part of the property, except for `wholeNumber`, which is renamed to `digit` because `wholeNumber` sounds more like an entire number than a single digit.

There is also `alphanumeric`, which is a `letter` or a `digit`.

`Line.start` matches at the beginning of the text, and after any newline characters. `Line.end` matches at the end of the text, and right before any newline characters. They both have a length of 0, which means the next pattern will start at the same position in the text.

`Line()` matches a single line, not including the newline characters.

`Word.boundary` matches the position right before or right after a word. Like `Line.start` and `Line.end` it also has a length of 0.


### Extracting data

All `Patterns` have a `.matches(in: String)` method which returns a lazy sequence of `Match` instances. Use their `.fullRange` property to access the full range matched by the pattern:

```swift
Patterns(Line()).matches(in: text).map { text[$0.fullRange] }
```

Often we are only interested in parts of a pattern. You can use the `Capture` pattern to assign a name to those parts:

```swift
let text = "This is a point: (43,7), so is (0,5). But my final point is (3,-1)."

let number = Patterns(OneOf("+-").repeat(0 ... 1), digit.repeat(1...))
let point = Patterns("(\(Capture(name: "x", number)),\(Capture(name: "y", number)))")

struct Point: Codable, Equatable {
	let x, y: Int
}

let points = try point.decode([Point].self, from: text)
```

If you don't want to create new types, you can use subscripting:

```swift
let pointsAsSubstrings = point.matches(in: text).map { match in
	(text[match[one: "x"]!], text[match[one: "y"]!])
}
```

You can also use `match[multiple: name]` if captures with that name may be matched multiple times. `match[one: name]` only returns the first capture of that name.


## Installation

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Add this to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kareman/Patterns.git", .branch("master")),
]
```

### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

Add to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Patterns', :git => 'https://github.com/kareman/Patterns.git'
```

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Add to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "kareman/Patterns"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Patterns.framework` into your Xcode project. 

In your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any dependency managers, you can integrate Patterns into your project manually. Just drag the `Sources` folder into your Xcode project.
