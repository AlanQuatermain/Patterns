# Patterns

Patterns is a Swift framework for searching for text patterns, similar in functionality to regex.

Its primary goal is to be easier to read than regexes.

There is also a [Mac application](https://nottoobadsoftware.com/Patterns/) of the same name, which can automatically generate Patterns patterns.

## Features

- [x] Easier to read
- [x] Easier to write
- [x] Cross-platform
- [x] Negation 
- [ ] Support human language features like word, sentence and paragraph.
- [ ] Fast

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kareman/Patterns.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

### CocoaPods

Patterns is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'Patterns', :git => 'https://github.com/kareman/Patterns.git'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate Patterns into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "kareman/Patterns"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Patterns.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Patterns into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
