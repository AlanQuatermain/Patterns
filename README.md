# Patterns

Patterns is a Swift library for Parser Expression Grammars (PEG). It can be used to create regular expressions (like regex‚Äôes) and grammars (for parsers).

For general information about PEGs, see [the original paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/982962.964011) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar).

## Example

```swift
let text = "This is a point: (43,7), so is (0, 5). But my final point is (3,-1)."

let number = ("+" / "-" / "") ‚Ä¢ digit+
let point = "(" ‚Ä¢ Capture(name: "x", number)
	‚Ä¢ "," ‚Ä¢ " "¬ø ‚Ä¢ Capture(name: "y", number) ‚Ä¢ ")"

struct Point: Codable {
	let x, y: Int
}

let points = try Parser(search: point).decode([Point].self, from: text)
// points == [Point(x: 43, y: 7), Point(x: 0, y: 5), Point(x: 3, y: -1)]
```

## Usage

Patterns are defined directly in code, instead of in a text string.

```swift
let a = punctuation ‚Ä¢ " "
```

This matches one punctuation character followed by a space. The `‚Ä¢` operator (Option-8 on U.S. keyboards, Option-Q on Norwegian ones) is used to create a pattern from a sequence of other patterns.

Any text within double quotes matches that exact text, no need to escape special letters with `\`. If you want to turn a string variable `s` into a pattern, use `Literal(s)`.

`OneOf` is like character classes from regular expressions, and matches 1 character. `OneOf("aeiouAEIOU")` matches any single character in that string, and `OneOf("a"..."e")` matches any of "abcde". They can also be combined, like `OneOf("aeiou", punctuation, "x"..."z")`. And you can implement one yourself:

```swift
OneOf(description: "ten") { character in
	character.wholeNumberValue == 10
}
```

It takes a closure `@escaping (Character) -> Bool` and matches any character for which the closure returns `true`. The description parameter is only used when creating a textual representation of the pattern.
 
`a*`  matches 0 or more, as many as it can (It is greedy, like the regex  `a*?`). So a pattern like `a+ ‚Ä¢ a` will never match anything because the repeated `a` pattern will always match all it can, leaving nothing left for the last `a`.

`a+`  matches 1 or more, also as many as it can (like the regex  `a+?`).

`a¬ø` makes `a` optional, but it always matches if it can (the `¬ø` character is Option-Shift-TheKeyWith?OnIt on most keyboards).

`a.repeat(2)` matches 2 of that pattern in a row. `a.repeat(...2)` matches 0, 1 or 2, `a.repeat(2...)` matches 2 or more and `a.repeat(3...6)` between 3 and 6. 

`a / b` first tries the pattern on the left. If that fails it tries the pattern on the right.

### Predefined patterns

There are predefined OneOf patterns for all the boolean `is...` properties of Swift's `Character`: `letter`, `lowercase`, `uppercase`, `punctuation`, `whitespace`, `newline`, `hexDigit`, `digit`, `ascii`, `symbol`, `mathSymbol`, `currencySymbol`.

They all have the same name as the last part of the property, except for `wholeNumber`, which is renamed to `digit` because `wholeNumber` sounds more like an entire number than a single digit.

There is also `alphanumeric`, which is a `letter` or a `digit`.

`Line.start` matches at the beginning of the text, and after any newline characters. `Line.end` matches at the end of the text, and right before any newline characters. They both have a length of 0, which means the next pattern will start at the same position in the text.

`Line()` matches a single line, not including the newline characters. So `Line() ‚Ä¢ Line()` will never match anything, but `Line() ‚Ä¢ "\n" ‚Ä¢ Line()` matches 2 lines.

`Word.boundary` matches the position right before or right after a word. Like `Line.start` and `Line.end` it also has a length of 0.

`Skip() ‚Ä¢ a ‚Ä¢ b` finds the first match of `a ‚Ä¢ b` from the current position.

### Parsing

To actually use a pattern, pass it to a Parser:

```swift
let parser = try Parser(search: a)
for match in parser.matches(in: text) {
	// ...
}
```

`Parser(search: a)` searches for the first match for `a`. It is the same as `Parser(Skip() ‚Ä¢ a)`.

The `.matches(in: String)` method returns a lazy sequence of `Match` instances.

Often we are only interested in parts of a pattern. You can use the `Capture` pattern to assign a name to those parts:

```swift
let text = "This is a point: (43,7), so is (0, 5). But my final point is (3,-1)."

let number = ("+" / "-" / "") ‚Ä¢ digit+
let point = "(" ‚Ä¢ Capture(name: "x", number)
	‚Ä¢ "," ‚Ä¢ " "¬ø ‚Ä¢ Capture(name: "y", number) ‚Ä¢ ")"

struct Point: Codable {
	let x, y: Int
}

let points = try Parser(search: point).decode([Point].self, from: text)
```

Or you can use subscripting:

```swift
let pointsAsSubstrings = point.matches(in: text).map { match in
	(text[match[one: "x"]!], text[match[one: "y"]!])
}
```

You can also use `match[multiple: name]` to get an array if captures with that name may be matched multiple times. `match[one: name]` only returns the first capture of that name.

## Setup

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Add this to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kareman/Patterns.git", .branch("master")),
]
```

or choose ‚ÄúAdd Package Dependency‚Äù from within Xcode.

### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

Add to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Patterns', :git => 'https://github.com/kareman/Patterns.git'
```

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Add to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "kareman/Patterns"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Patterns.framework` into your Xcode project. 

In your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

## Implementation

Patterns is implemented using a virtual parsing machine, similar to how [LPEG](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/) is [implemented](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf). See also the `backtrackingvm` function described [here](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html).
